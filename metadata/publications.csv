We describe two approaches employed to measure gender stereotypes: An explicit questionnaire based on rating scales and a newly developed Implicit Association Test assessing gender stereotypes representing instrumentality (i.e., agency) and expressivity (i.e., communion). We first present information on psychometric properties of each stereotype measure designed for this purpose. We then present preliminary data based on the SOEP Innovation Sample 2011 indicating differences in explicit stereotypes with reference to occupational position and income. Implicit stereotypic associations concerning expressivity increased with respondents’ age and stereotypic associations concerning instrumentality increased with household income, particularly among male participants. Finally, stereotypic associations were related simultaneously to occupational position and participants’ gender, such that differences between male and female participants were found in lower occupational positions for the Expressivity IAT and in higher occupational positions for the Instrumentality IAT. This finding indicates that individually held gender stereotypes are related to socioeconomic and social variables.","Julia Dietrich, Konrad Schnabel, Tuulia Ortner, Alice Eagly, Rocio Garcia-Retamero, Lea Kröger, Elke Holst. 2013: Internalized Gender Stereotypes Vary Across Socioeconomic Indicators.

Respondents allocate a fixed budget between a safe asset and a risky asset whose returns are tied to the German stock market and earn monetary returns based on their decisions. Experimental investment choices correlate with beliefs about stock market returns and exhibit desirable external validity: They are a strong predictor for reallife stock market participation. The experimental set-up allows exogenous modification of the risky asset’s return but investments are inelastic except for financially savvy subsamples.

8799,"Control Strivings in the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP)","Ina Schöllgen, Denis Gerstorf, Jutta Heckhausen",2014,"The Motivational Theory of Life-Span Development (MTD) identifies motivational and self-regulatory strategies that people use to meet the challenges they face throughout life. The theory distinguishes control strivings related to goal engagement from those related to goal disengagement and goal reengagement. In the Innovation Sample of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-IS), these control strivings were surveyed using 12-item scales for key domains of life: work, family, and health. In this report, we first present key concepts and principles of MTD and a brief overview of research using the theory. This provides the backdrop for our discussion of the relevance of control strivings for major thematic areas covered in the SOEP and for the proposed domain-specific assessment of control strivings. Second, we examine the reliability and factor structure of the scales, using data from the SOEP Innovation Sample collected in 2012. In a third and final step, we sketch possible projects that make use of the rich SOEP data so as to examine pivotal questions revolving around the nature of control strivings (changes) across adulthood and old age as well as their antecedents, correlates, and consequences. In line with predictions based on MTD, results revealed mostly moderate to high inter-item correlations for selective primary control, selective secondary control, and compensatory primary control, with all items loading on a single goal engagement factor. Our results further show that disengagement, self-protection and re-engagement are interrelated, but distinguishable strategies for dealing with unattainable goals.","Ina Schöllgen, Denis Gerstorf, Jutta Heckhausen. 2014: Control Strivings in the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP).

We focus on two facets of dispositional justice sensitivity that reflect individual differences in perception and reactions to perpetrating injustice against others (perpetrator sensitivity) or suffering from the injustice of others as an innocent victim (victim sensitivity). We hypothesised that the negative effect of unemployment on life satisfaction is stronger among individuals with higher levels of victim sensitivity and perpetrator sensitivity. The former are more likely to perceive themselves as victims of an unjust situation, such as fate or the employer's decisions, whereas the latter are more likely to perceive themselves as perpetrators against the rules of social justice. Using survey data from approximately 400 participants, we found that unemployed individuals were less satisfied with life than employed individuals and that this relationship was stronger for perpetrator-sensitive individuals. Unemployed perpetrator-sensitive individuals were more likely to engage in active job-seeking behavior and faced a lower likelihood of long-term unemployment. The results are discussed in terms of the importance of justice-related personality aspects of unemployed individuals for their well-being and labor market outcomes.","Olga Stavrova, Thomas Schlösser, Anna Baumert. 2014: Life Satisfaction and Job-Seeking Behavior of the Unemployed: The Effect of Individual Differences in Justice Sensitivity.

8991,"Sustainable consumption in capability perspective: Operationalization and empirical illustration","Ortrud Leßmann, Torsten Masson",2015,"The present research combines the capability approach (CA) with the theory of planned behavior (TPB) to investigate the effects of social norms and personal autonomy on sustainable consumption behavior. The approaches bear some similarities, but differ in that the CA attaches more importance to autonomy and highlights the indirect effects of social influence. In contrast to TPB, the CA suggests indirect norm effects (on behavior) by shaping attitudes and the perception of freedom of choice. Furthermore, the CA hints at the motivational power of personal autonomy for behavioral choices. We develop a combined model to test our assumptions for two sustainable consumption behaviors (i.e., purchase of organic food and mobility behavior). Testing the combined model based on cross-sectional data of the German socio-economic panel (GSOEP-IS) confirms the significance of the CA for sustainable consumption. The policy implications of the findings are enhancing people's opportunities for sustainable consumption in order to strengthen sustainable behavior.","Ortrud Leßmann, Torsten Masson. 2015: Sustainable consumption in capability perspective: Operationalization and empirical illustration.

Brent Donnellan",2017,"The Day Reconstruction Method (DRM) is a useful tool for evaluating short-term changes in emotional experiences over a variety of daily situations. However, traditional method of collecting DRM data can be time-intensive for both researchers and participants. In this paper we provide evidence that a random-sampling approach to DRM assessment can provide useful data that are largely consistent with previous research that used the full version of the DRM. In a nationally representative sample of 2303 people, we demonstrate that (1) there is variability in emotional ratings of episodes that replicates what has been found in prior studies, (2) correlations with global measures are typically small in magnitude (<0.30), (3) correlations with personality are for the most part negligible, (4) correlations with global ratings of domain satisfaction are higher for domain-relevant situations, and (5) parents report more positive affect while providing care for their children when compared to other activities, and this effect can account for the observed differences in emotional experiences of parents and non-parents.","Ivana Anusic, Richard E.

The Basic Social Justice Orientations (BSJO) scale is an eight-item scale that measures agreement with the equality, equity, need, and entitlement principle. In contrast to comparable other scales that have been used in justice research in the past, the BSJO scale is consistent with the current state of empirical justice research andallows for the study of the constructs distinguished by studies in that area and, more specifically, in the context of population surveys and with respect to societal distribution conflicts. The paper reports the methodological aspects of the construction and use of the scale in population surveys, as well as results concerning reliability and construct validation. The study uses data from three general social surveys that have been conducted in Germany: LINOS-1, SOEP Innovation Sample 2012, and ALLBUS 2014. The analysis of these three data sets confirms the assumed four-factorial structure of the justice dimensions, and the validation of the construct confirms the hypothesized relationships between the dimensions of the BSJO scale and socio-structural characteristics, political attitudes, and other justice related attitudes.","Stefan Liebig, Sebastian Hülle, Meike May. 2016: Principles of the Just Distribution of Benefits and Burdens: The ""Basic Social Justice Orientations"" Scale for Measuring Order-Related Social Justice Attitudes.

While many personality inventories were originally developed in the context of self-administered questionnaires, they are often used by large surveys in face-to-face interview settings instead.

Although in some cases we found slightly stronger associations between interviewer and respondent personality in face-to-face settings, the results generally suggested strict measurement invariance–and therefore full comparability–across methods of data collection.","Luisa Hilgert, Martin Kroh, David Richter. 2016: The effect of face-to-face interviewing on personality measurement.

The present study used longitudinal data from an approximately representative German sample to replicate and extend these findings. Our results largely replicated Kushlev et al.’s results: Income predicted less daily sadness (albeit with a smaller effect size) but was unrelated to happiness. Moreover, the association between income and sadness could not be explained by demographics, stress, or daily time use. Extending Kushlev et al.’s findings, new analyses indicated that only between-persons variance in income (but not within-persons variance) predicted daily sadness—perhaps because there was relatively little within-persons variance in income. Finally, income predicted less daily sadness and worry, but not less anger or frustration—potentially suggesting that income predicts less “internalizing” but not less “externalizing” negative emotions. Together, our study and Kushlev et al.’s study provide evidence that income robustly predicts select daily negative emotions—but not positive ones.","Nathan W. Hudson, Richard E. Lucas, M.

Fewer studies, however, have examined the extent to which people’s in vivo experiences of well-being (e.g., felt emotions) vary as a function of age—and the existing findings are mixed. The present study used an approximately nationally representative sample of more than 2,500 Germans to evaluate developmental patterns in both experiential and global well-being using cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses. The cross-sectional and longitudinal findings converged on the idea that affect—whether positive or negative, global or experiential—decreases as a function of age and time. In contrast, life satisfaction appears to remain consistent, or perhaps decline across midlife before rebounding in old age.

Back",2018,"Due to increased empirical interest in narcissism across social sciences, there is a need for inventories that can be administered quickly while also reliably measuring both the agentic and antagonistic aspects of grandiose narcissism. In this study, we sought to validate the factor structure, provide representative descriptive data and reliability estimates, assess the reliability across the trait spectrum, and examine the nomological network of the short version (NARQ-S) of the Narcissistic Admiration and Rivalry Questionnaire (Back et al., 2013). We used data from a large convenience sample (total N = 11,937) as well as data from a large representative sample (total N = 4,433) that included responses to other narcissism measures as well as related constructs, including the other Dark Triad traits, Big Five personality traits, and self-esteem. Confirmatory factor analysis and Item Response Theory were used to validate the factor structure and estimate the reliability across the latent trait spectrum, respectively. Results suggest that the NARQ-S shows a robust factor structure and is a reliable and valid short measure of the agentic and antagonistic aspects of grandiose narcissism. We also discuss future directions and applications of the NARQ-S as a short and comprehensive measure of grandiose narcissism.","Marius Leckelt, Eunike Wetzel, Tanja M. Gerlach, Robert A.

9961,"Experimental and Survey Evidence on the Development of Preferences and Skills (dissertation)","Elisabeth Bügelmayer",2015,"The focus of this research is on decisions related to human capital formation and preferences crucial for social interaction. These decisions are analyzed at different stages of the life-cycle, starting with other-regarding preferences in preschoolers, followed by skill formation in adolescents and preferences for honesty in adults. Answering the questions on skill formation and human capital accumulation was possible by exploiting the full potential the data provided, that is by combining different data types as well as making use of the data structure and analyzing paradata from the data collection process. Thus, this dissertation contributes to the literature by combining survey data, experimental data and paradata to analyze factors that influence individual decision-making. An important aspect this thesis focuses on are environmental factors that influence decision-making. These include family or community factors or situational factors in an experiment. Spite and cognitive skills in preschoolers: Other-regarding preferences in adults have been examined in depth in the literature. Research has shown that spiteful preferences play a crucial role in the development of human large-scale cooperation. However, there is little evidence of the factors explaining spiteful behavior in children. We investigate the relationship between children’s cognitive skills and spiteful behavior in a sample of 214 preschoolers aged 5-6 and their mothers. Here, other-regarding behavior in children is elicited through four simple allocation decisions. A key advantage of our study is that we have information about children’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills as well as maternal and household characteristics. We find that higher cognitive skills are associated with more spiteful behavior in children. This relationship is even more pronounced among boys. Moreover, we find further gender differences that depend on the measure of cognitive skills and the degree of spite displayed. Is it the family or the neighborhood? Evidence from sibling and neighbor correlations in youth education and health: In this paper we present sibling and neighbor correlations in school grades and cognitive skills as well as indicators of physical and mental health for a sample of German adolescents. In a first step, we estimate sibling correlations and find substantial influence of shared family and community background on all outcomes. To further disentangle the influence of family background and neighborhood, we estimate neighbor correlations. Our results show that for all outcomes, estimated neighbor correlations are clearly lower than estimated sibling correlations. However, especially for cognitive skills and mental health, neighbor correlations are still substantial in relation to sibling correlations. Thus, compared to existing results from other countries, the influence of the neighborhood is not negligible in Germany for these outcomes. Who lies and to whom? Experimental evidence on cheating in a household survey context: In this paper, I evaluate a cheating experiment implemented in the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) Study. My results show no relationship between cheating and socio-economic characteristics, personality traits, or economic preference parameters, except between cheating and education. I also study a high- and a low-stakes treatment to test the robustness of cheating in the face of increased gains. The results indicate that people cheat more when potential gains from doing so are greater, but that education appears to be a mediating factor. Further, I carry out a closer analysis of the decision-making situation focusing on the relationship between interviewer characteristics and the probability of cheating. This analysis provides the novel result that some interviewer characteristics—such as gender—significantly increase the probability of cheating.","Elisabeth Bügelmayer. 2015: Experimental and Survey Evidence on the Development of Preferences and Skills (dissertation).

10141,"Measuring Attitudes Toward Distributive Justice: The Basic Social Justice Orientations Scale","Sebastian Hülle, Stefan Liebig, Meike Janina May",2018,"Previous research on social inequalities relied primarily on objective indicators. According to recent studies, however, subjective indicators that reflect a person’s perceptions and evaluations of inequalities are also relevant. Such evaluations depend on an individual’s normative orientation, so respective attitudes toward distributive justice need to be accounted for appropriately. This article introduces a short scale for measuring such order-related justice attitudes. The introduced Basic Social Justice Orientations (BSJO) scale comprises current insights into the empirical justice research and measures individuals’ attitudes toward the following four basic distributive principles: equality, need, equity, and entitlement. The BSJO scale has four dimensions that measure support for these four justice principles on the basis of eight items. We assess the quality of the scale using data from three general population surveys conducted in Germany: the first wave of the panel “Legitimation of Inequality Over the Life Span” (LINOS-1), the Innovation Sample of the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP-IS 2012), and the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS 2014). The scale was found to be a valid instrument that can be used to measure order-related justice attitudes toward distributive justice. The BSJO scale is a short and therefore time-efficient instrument that can be implemented in general population surveys.","Sebastian Hülle, Stefan Liebig, Meike Janina May. 2018: Measuring Attitudes Toward Distributive Justice: The Basic Social Justice Orientations Scale.

Data were drawn from the German Socio-Economic Panel which contains detailed information on the sports behaviour of adults in Germany. Overall, two different measures of seasonal variation are developed and used as dependent variables in our regression models. The first variable measures the coefficient of (seasonal) variation in sport-related energy expenditure per week. The second variable measures whether activity drops below the threshold as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). Results suggest that the organisational setting, the intensity and number of sports practised, and the motive for participation are strongly correlated with the variation measures used. For example, both, participation in a sports club and a commercial facility, are associated with reduced seasonal variation and a significantly higher probability of participating at a volume above the WHO threshold across all seasons. These findings give some impetus for policymaking and the planning of sports programmes as well as future research directions.","Ute Schüttoff, Tim Pawlowski. 2018: Seasonal variation in sports participation.

10594,"Examining the “Veggie” personality: Results from a representative German sample","Tamara M. Pfeiler, Boris Egloff",2018,"An increasing proportion of people choose to follow a vegetarian diet. To date, however, little is known about if and how individual differences in personality relate to following a vegetarian diet. In the two studies presented here, we aimed to (1) estimate the prevalence of self-defined vegetarians in two waves of a German representative sample (N = 4496 and 5,125, respectively), (2) analyze the effect of socio-demographic variables on dietary behavior, and (3) examine individual differences between vegetarians and meat eaters in personality traits, political attitudes, and health-related variables. In Study 1, a strict definition of vegetarians was used, while in Study 2 the definition was laxer, to include also individuals who only predominantly followed a vegetarian diet. The prevalence of self-defined vegetarians was 2.74% in Study 1, and 5.97% in Study 2. Participants who were female, younger, and more educated were more likely to report following a vegetarian diet in both studies, and vegetarians had higher income as compared to meat eaters in Study 2. We also found differences between vegetarians and meat eaters with regard to personality traits, political attitudes, and health-related variables. Stepwise logistic regression analyses showed a unique effect beyond socio-demographic variables for openness (Studies 1 and 2), conscientiousness (Study 1), trust (Study 2), conservatism (Studies 1 and 2), and level of interest in politics (Study 1) on diet: Individuals with higher scores in openness and political interest had a higher probability of being vegetarian, whereas people with higher scores in conscientiousness and conservatism had a smaller likelihood of being vegetarian. We conclude that there are individual differences between vegetarians and meat eaters in socio-demographics, personality traits, and political attitudes.","Tamara M.

10619,"Personality and attitudinal correlates of meat consumption: Results of two representative German samples","Tamara M. Pfeiler, Boris Egloff",2018,"The vast amount of meat consumed in the Western world is critically discussed with regard to negative health consequences, environmental impact, and ethical concerns for animals, emphasizing the need to extend knowledge regarding the correlates of meat consumption in the general population. In the present article, we conducted two studies examining the associations between meat consumption and personality traits, political attitudes, and environmental attitudes in two large German representative samples (Ntotal = 8,879, aged 18–96 years). Cross-sectional data on frequency of meat consumption, socio-demographics, personality traits, and political and environmental attitudes were collected via self-reports. In both studies, male sex, younger age, and lower educational attainment were significantly positively related to meat consumption. In Study 1, results of the partial correlations and the hierarchical regression analysis controlling for socio-demographics showed that the personality traits of openness and agreeableness, as well as conservative political and social views, explained unique variance in meat consumption. In Study 2, partial correlations and hierarchical regression analyses showed that openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were all uniquely negatively related to meat consumption. Moreover, these analyses documented that people scoring high in right-wing attitudes and low in pro-environmental attitudes reported more overall meat consumption. Taken together, these two studies provided evidence that socio-demographics, personality traits, and attitudes are indeed related to how much meat is consumed. Implications and future prospects for the study of individual differences in meat consumption are discussed.","Tamara M.

We document that children from high SES families are more intelligent, patient and altruistic, as well as less risk-seeking. To understand the underlying causes and mechanisms, we propose a framework of how parental investments as well as maternal IQ and economic preferences influence a child's IQ and preferences. Within this framework, we allow SES to influence both the level of parental time and parenting style investments, as well as the productivity of the investment process. Our results indicate that disparities in the level of parental investments hold substantial importance for SES gaps in economic preferences and, to a lesser extent, IQ. In light of the importance of IQ and preferences for behaviors and outcomes, our findings offer an explanation for social immobility.","Thomas Deckers, Armin Falk, Fabian Kosse, Pia Pinger, Hannah Schildberg-Hörisch. 2017: Socio-Economic Status and Inequalities in Children's IQ and Economic Preferences.

10703,"Capturing Affective Well-Being in Daily Life with the Day Reconstruction Method: A Refined View on Positive and Negative Affect","Dave Möwisch, Florian Schmiedek, David Richter, Annette Brose",2019,"In the last years, there has been a shift from traditional measurements of affective well-being to approaches such as the day reconstruction method (DRM). While the traditional approaches often assess trait level differences in well-being, the DRM allows examining affective dynamics in everyday contexts. The latter may ultimately explain why some people feel more happy than others (e.g., because they experience more gratification during everyday experiences). Even though DRM research has increased in the last years, little is known about the structure of affective well-being in everyday life, and potential structural differences of affect at the within- and between-person level have rarely been considered. We thus thoroughly examined the structure of affective well-being in daily life, using data from a nationally representative sample (N<U+2009>=<U+2009>2401) of the German Socioeconomic Panel Innovation Sample that were obtained with the DRM. Multilevel structural equation models revealed that (1) affective well-being in daily life cannot be reduced to the two global dimensions positive and negative affect (PA and NA) but that the structure of NA is more nuanced; (2) the emerging subfacets of NA have distinct associations with global indicators of well-being (e.g., life satisfaction); (3) there are structural differences of affective well-being at the within- and between-person level, and (4) the relationships between affect subfacets and activities such as “work” can be opposed at the within- and between-person level. These results show that a more differentiated view on the structure of affect contributes to a better understanding of affective well-being in everyday life.","Dave Möwisch, Florian Schmiedek, David Richter, Annette Brose. 2019: Capturing Affective Well-Being in Daily Life with the Day Reconstruction Method: A Refined View on Positive and Negative Affect.

Schmukle",2018,"Happiness is considered a highly desirable attribute, but whether or not individuals can actively steer their lives toward greater well-being is an open empirical question. In this study, respondents from a representative German sample reported, in text format, ideas for how they could improve their life satisfaction. We investigated which of these ideas predicted changes in life satisfaction 1 year later. Active pursuits per se—as opposed to statements about external circumstances or fortune—were not associated with changes in life satisfaction (n = 1,178). However, in line with our preregistered hypothesis, among individuals who described active pursuits (n = 582), those who described social ideas (e.g., spending more time with friends and family) ended up being more satisfied, and this effect was partly mediated by increased socializing. Our results demonstrate that not all pursuits of happiness are equally successful and corroborate the great importance of social relationships for human well-being.","Julia M.

10751,"The dominance of introspective measures and what this implies: The example of environmental attitude","Siegmar Otto, Ulf Kröhne, David Richter",2018,"The behavioral sciences, including most of psychology, seek to explain and predict behavior with the help of theories and models that involve concepts (e.g., attitudes) that are subsequently translated into measures. Currently, some subdisciplines such as social psychology focus almost exclusively on measures that demand reflection or even introspection when administered to persons. We argue that such a focus hinders progress in explaining behavior. One major reason is that such an exclusive focus on reflections results in common method bias, which then produces spurious relations, or in other words, low discriminant validity. Without the valid measurement of theoretical concepts, theoretical assumptions cannot be tested, and hence, theory development will be hampered. We argue that the use of a greater variety of methods would reduce these problems and would in turn foster theory building. Using a representative sample of N = 472 participants (age: M = 51.0, SD = 17.7; 54% female), we compared the validity of a classical introspective attitude measure (i.e., the New Ecological Paradigm) with that of an alternative attitude measure (i.e., the General Ecological Behavior scale). The latter measure, which was based on self-reported behavior, showed substantially better validity that we argue could aid theory development.","Siegmar Otto, Ulf Kröhne, David Richter. 2018: The dominance of introspective measures and what this implies: The example of environmental attitude.

11027,"The politics of credit claiming: Rights and recognition in health policy feedback","Diana Burlacu, Ellen M. Immergut, Maria Oskarson, Björn Rönnerstrand",2018,"Why do governments recognize rights? In this article, we rely on natural experiments and an innovative matching technique to identify a new causal mechanism of policy feedback, which we refer to as the “recognition” effect. We rely on the “hard case” of health care to demonstrate that attitudes towards the health system change in response to government policy change and, indeed, even to rights-based initiatives. During the time when public opinion surveys on public satisfaction with the health system were in the field, governments in both Germany and Sweden introduced a new right: the right to a maximum waiting time for health services. This serendipity allowed us to compare respondents' attitudes both before (control) and after the implementation of the waiting time guarantee (treatment), using coarsened exact matching to account for the imbalances in the treatment and control groups. We find that respondents interviewed after implementation of the new waiting time guarantees (in contrast to those interviewed before the introduction of the guarantees) express higher levels of satisfaction with the health system in general, but do not evaluate their specific medical treatment (including waiting times) more positively. We interpret this finding as evidence that citizens respond to governmental recognition of their rights as a good per se, independent of their personal experience with the particular public service at hand. Thus, we argue that theories of policy feedback need to move beyond their focus on direct material experience with the policies at hand, and to incorporate mechanisms of symbolic action and normative valuations into their causal models.","Diana Burlacu, Ellen M.

Dabei wird argumentiert, dass die Wählerschaft immer weniger mit den am breiten Konsens orientierten Volksparteien anfangen könne, da sie in ihren Werten und Interessen zu stark polarisiert sei. Aber wie stark unterscheiden sich die Wählergruppen tatsächlich in ihren grundlegenden Einstellungen, etwa im Hinblick auf ihre Gerechtigkeitsvorstellungen? Auf Grundlage von Daten aus dem Jahr 2018 wurde überprüft, welche Gerechtigkeitsprofile für die WählerInnen deutscher Parteien jeweils charakteristisch sind. Dabei zeigen sich einerseits Unterschiede: Zum Beispiel lehnen WählerInnen der Unionsparteien das Gleichheitsprinzip – also die gleiche Verteilung von Gütern und Lasten auf alle – besonders deutlich ab. UnterstützerInnen der Linken stehen dem positiver gegenüber. Aber es gibt auch Gemeinsamkeiten:  Die Verteilung nach dem Leistungsprinzip wird über alle Parteigrenzen hinweg als gerecht empfunden. Auch die Forderung, dass allen Menschen entsprechend des Bedarfsprinzips ein minimaler Lebensstandard zugesichert werden sollte, wird breit unterstützt.","Philipp Eisnecker, Jule Adriaans, Stefan Liebig. 2018: Was macht Gerechtigkeit aus?

11171,"Social Explanations of Lottery Play: New Evidence Based on National Survey Data","Mark Lutter, Daria Tisch, Jens Beckert",2018,"This study examines the social contexts of gambling and analyzes social motivations for playing the lottery. We test three sociological approaches simultaneously: network effects, consumption theory, and strain theory. The data used (SOEP-IS, N = 5868 individuals) has several advantages beyond being a large-scale representative sample of the German population. With information on households, we can analyze social network effects while avoiding the problems of egocentric network data. Another benefit of the SOEP-IS is the panel structure. We use the panel structure to improve measurements of strain theory by using the decline in income over time as a measure for it. Our results suggest that the three theories explain different aspects of lottery play. Networks seem to have an influence on lottery play. Having another person in the household playing the lottery is positively associated with both the probability of playing (regularly) and expenditures on lottery tickets. Daydreams and the belief in good luck are positively associated with lottery play as well. Strain theory is confirmed insofar as we find that a decline in income is significantly related to expenditures but not to the probability of playing the lottery. Overall, this study suggests that people play the lottery depending on their social surroundings, their desire to participate in a world normally out of their reach, and the tensions they feel from the distance between their aspirations and their actual social position.","Mark Lutter, Daria Tisch, Jens Beckert. 2018: Social Explanations of Lottery Play: New Evidence Based on National Survey Data.

One typical application is a household. We run an experiment in the German Socio-Economic Panel with two members from 494 households. Participants have a good estimate of each other’s risk preferences, even if not explicitly informed. They do not simply match this preference when deciding on behalf of the other household member, but shy away from exposing others to risk. We model the situation, and we <U+FB01>nd four distinct types of individuals, and two distinct types of households.","Christoph Engel, Alexandra Fedorets, Olga Gorelkina. 2018: How Do Households Allocate Risk?

Participants (n = 2,854) lived in the same household and were part of a large, nationally representative panel study in Germany. Each partner independently predicted the other’s preferences for several common food items. Results show that predictive accuracy was higher for likes and for extreme and stereotypical preferences as compared to dislikes and for moderate and idiosyncratic preferences. Accuracy was also higher for couples with a high similarity in preferences and with longer relationship duration but was independent of participants’ age after controlling for relationship duration. The data also show that relationship duration was accompanied by higher similarity in couples’ food preferences. There was a small positive correlation between partner knowledge and both partner similarity and satisfaction with family life, but no correlation between partner knowledge and general life satisfaction. The results reconcile both valence and base-rate accounts of preference prediction accuracy.","Benjamin Scheibehenne, Jutta Mata, David Richter. 2019: Accuracy of Food Preference Predictions in Couples.

11364,"Depression, Risk Preferences and Risk-Taking Behavior","Deborah A. Cobb-Clark, Sarah Dahmann, Nathan Kettlewell",2019,"Depression affects the way that people process information and make decisions, including those involving risk and uncertainty. Our objective is to analyze the way that depressive episodes shape risk preferences and risk-taking behaviors. We are the first to address this issue using large-scale, representative panel data that include both behavioral and stated risk preference measures and a theoretical framework that accounts for the multiple pathways through which depression affects risk-taking. We find no disparity in the behavioral risk preferences of the mentally well vs. depressed; yet depression is related to people’s stated risk preferences and risk-taking behaviors in ways that are context-specific. Those who are likely to be experiencing a depressive episode report less willingness to take risks in general, but more willingness to take health risks, for example. We investigate these patterns by developing a conceptual model — informed by the psychological literature — that links depression to risk-taking behavior through the key elements of a standard intertemporal choice problem (e.g., time preferences, expectations, budget constraints). This motivates a mediation analysis in which we show that differences in risk-taking behavior are largely explained by depression-related disparities in behavioral traits such as locus of control, optimism and trust. Overall, we find that there is no overarching tendency for those who are depressive to engage in either more or less risk-taking. Instead, the decision-making context matters in ways that largely align with our theoretical expectations.","Deborah A.

11434,"Zustimmung für bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen eher bei jungen, bei besser gebildeten Menschen sowie in unteren Einkommensschichten","Jule Adriaans, Stefan Liebig, Jürgen Schupp",2019,"Repräsentative Befragungsergebnisse zeigen in Deutschland seit 2016/17 eine stabile Zustimmungsrate zur Einführung eines bedingungslosen Grundeinkommens, zwischen 45 und 52 Prozent; im europäischen Vergleich sind diese Zustimmungsraten eher gering. Gerade junge, höher gebildete und von Armut bedrohte Menschen unterstützen in Deutschland die Idee eines bedingungslosen Grundeinkommens. Aber nicht nur die eigene Position, sondern auch subjektive Gerechtigkeitseinstellungen stehen im Zusammenhang mit der Einstellung zum bedingungslosen Grundeinkommen. Leistungsgerechtigkeit und bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen stehen scheinbar im Widerspruch. Werden hingegen Defizite bei der Deckung des Bedarfs im unteren Einkommensbereich der Gesellschaft festgestellt, geht dies eher mit einer Befürwortung des bedingungslosen Grundeinkommens einher. Die Analysen zeigen somit, dass die Einstellung zum bedingungslosen Grundeinkommen bestimmten Mustern und sozialen Regelmäßigkeiten folgt und im Zeitraum 2016 bis 2018 relativ stabil ist. Solange die gesellschaftlichen Kosten und Nutzen der Einführung eines solchen Grundeinkommens weitestgehend unklar sind, ist der vergleichsweise hohe Anteil an Befürworterinnen und Befürwortern mit Vorsicht zu interpretieren und nicht gleichzusetzen mit einer tatsächlichen Reformbereitschaft in der Bevölkerung.","Jule Adriaans, Stefan Liebig, Jürgen Schupp. 2019: Zustimmung für bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen eher bei jungen, bei besser gebildeten Menschen sowie in unteren Einkommensschichten.

11436,"In Germany, Younger, Better Educated Persons, and Lower Income Groups Are More Likely to Be in Favor of Unconditional Basic Income","Jule Adriaans, Stefan Liebig, Jürgen Schupp",2019,"Representative survey results have shown a stable approval rate for implementing unconditional basic income of between 45 and 52 percent in Germany since 2016/17. In European comparison, this approval rate is low. Younger, better educated persons, and those at risk of poverty support the concept of unconditional basic income in Germany. But these demographics are not the only factors that correlate with attitudes toward unconditional basic income: subjective justice attitudes do as well. The justice norm of equity and unconditional basic income appear to be contradictory. On the other hand, people who find that there are deficits in covering the needs of society’s lower income groups tend to approve of unconditional basic income. Therefore, analyses show that attitudes toward unconditional basic income follow specific patterns and social regularities; and they were relatively stable between 2016 and 2018. As long as uncertainty predominates regarding the social costs and benefits of implementing such a basic income, the relatively high proportion of those in favor must be interpreted with care. It does not indicate that society is actually ready for reforms in this direction.","Jule Adriaans, Stefan Liebig, Jürgen Schupp. 2019: In Germany, Younger, Better Educated Persons, and Lower Income Groups Are More Likely to Be in Favor of Unconditional Basic Income.

Lucas",2019,"This paper examines experienced well-being of employed and unemployed workers. We use the survey-adapted day reconstruction method (DRM) of the Innovation Sample of the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP-IS) to analyze the role of the employment status for well-being, incorporating complete time use. Summarizing the average share of pleasurable minutes, we generate the P-index. We show that - in contrast to evaluative life satisfaction - the average unemployed experiences more pleasurable minutes due to the absence of working episodes. Hence, we examine working episodes in depth. While working is among the activities with the highest propensities for an unpleasant experience, it is also among the most meaningful activities. We show that meaning is a central non-monetary determinant for a pleasurable work episode and find that pleasure during work and job satisfaction in general have the same association with meaning.","Tobias Wolf, Maria Metzing, Richard E.

Hales, Mirella Walker, Rainer Greifeneder",2019,"Ostracism, excluding and ignoring others, results from a variety of factors. Here, we investigate the effect of personality on the likelihood of becoming a target of ostracism. Theorizing that individuals low in conscientiousness or agreeableness are at risk of getting ostracized, we tested our hypotheses within 5 preregistered studies: Four experiments investigating participants’ willingness to ostracize targets characterized by different personality traits and a reverse correlation face modeling study where we determined and subsequently validated the stereotypical face of an ostracized person. A survey study within a representative German data panel further corroborated our findings. In line with our hypotheses, persons low in conscientiousness or agreeableness provoke more ostracism intentions (Studies 1, 2, and 4), are more likely to be actually ostracized by others (Study 3), represent the stereotype of an “ostracizable” person (Study 5), and report experiencing more ostracism (Study 6). Effects remained stable even after controlling for likability of the target (Study 2 and 4). Moreover, being described as negative on 1 personality dimension could not be compensated by being described as positive on the other (Study 4). In exploratory analyses, we further investigated the effects of openness to experience, neuroticism, and extraversion. In sum, we find evidence that personality affects the likelihood of becoming a target of ostracism, and that especially low agreeableness and conscientiousness represent risk factors.
